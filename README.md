# Hack Cambridge Website ![alt tag](https://travis-ci.org/Moosichu/moosichu.com.svg)

This is the code to My (Tom Read-Cutting's) personal website, being built in nodejs. At first it's simply going to be a portfolio
and a place for me to throw some experimental stuff on the web.

Eventually I'm hoping it will be a lot more full-featured with a blog and everything, but for now I'm keeping it simple.

## Getting Started

To run the website on your machine, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Then inside this folder, run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then go to localhost on port 3000 to see it running.
